Utilaclock

Utilaclock is a simple clock utility. It opens any number of clocks in separate
windows. It can also create countdowns and timers.
Count downs change color and start counting up after they reach zero.
The font size can now be set for each clock.

Utilaclock was developed at Puyallup Foursquare Church
(http://myfoursquarechurch.com) to use as a clock on our campuses.
